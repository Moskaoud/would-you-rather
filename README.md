# Project Overview
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
# App Functionality
- logging in as an existing user.
- home page information about the logged in user should appear on the page.If someone tries to navigate anywhere by entering the address in the address bar, the user is asked to sign in and then the requested page is shown. The application allows the user to log out and log back in.

- Once the user logs in, the user should be able to toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls on the home page The polls in both categories are arranged from the most recently created (top) to the least recently created (bottom). The unanswered questions should be shown by default, and the name of the logged in user should be visible on the page.

- The details of each poll should be available at questions/:question_id, application show a 404 page if the user is trying to access a poll that does not exist.
